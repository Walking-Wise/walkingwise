                  ? `Children and adolescents are naturally vulnerable to sex offenders and human traffickers due to their cognitive immaturity and limited life experience, which affects their decision making abilities. A youthâ€™s inherent obedience and financial dependence on adults can also make them easy targets when living with, or in proximity to, a sexual predator. Particularly vulnerable populations include individuals from marginalized communities, such as LGBTQ+ youth, undocumented immigrants, and those with a history of trauma or abuse. Providing education enables adults and adolescents to understand how human traffickers prey on at risk populations and empowers them to recognize and respond to manipulation, intimidation, and coercion.`
                  : `Human traffickers and sexual predators often use love bonds, debt bonds, drug bonds, and family bonds to maintain control over their victims. These perpetrators commit emotionally and physically harmful acts against vulnerable populations, commonly persuading victims to believe they are responsible for the crimes inflicted upon them. Educating adults and adolescents about the risk factors and indicators of human trafficking will help them recognize the vulnerabilities that sexual predators exploit and the signs that appear once someone has been entrapped in the commercial sex industry.`}
